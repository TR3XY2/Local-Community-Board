# üì¢ Local Community Board

Local Community Board (LCB) is a desktop application designed to strengthen communication and collaboration within a local community ‚Äî such as a neighborhood, dormitory, or university campus.

It allows community members to:

- Organize and join events (meetings, clean-ups, social gatherings, workshops)

- Subscribe to specific areas to receive personalized notifications (e.g. Sports, Education, Repairs)

- Search through all types of content with advanced filters

Everyone can view public content as a Guest, but only registered Users can post and interact. Admins maintain the system, moderate content, and manage user roles.

This system centralizes all local community events in one convenient and secure platform.
